      <h1 id="a-story-of-an-app-development">A Story of an App Development</h1>

<p>This document helps you to understand the basic idea of <strong>uniqush-push</strong> by telling a imaginary story of a group of app developers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Once upon a time, there was a group of developers developing weather report app for mobile devices.
They were from the open source community and hence preferred open platforms. Android was their choice.</li>
  <li>The idea of their app was naive and simple: sending weather report from their server to their app every day.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="img/intro/android-and-android-rain.png" alt="android-and-android-rain" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>On android platform, sending a notification to an app is easy: <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> provides a cloud service, <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/gcm">Google Cloud Message</a>, or GCM, to help developers to send data from servers to apps.</li>
  <li>Developers could push any data to their apps by sending an HTTP request to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/gcm">GCM</a> cloud.</li>
  <li>Empowered by <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/gcm">GCM</a>, the developers were quite happy to write server side programs. They didn&#8217;t need to consider the systems on which the app run. <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/gcm">GCM</a> did all works. Everything they need to do was grabbing weather information, establishing HTTP connection to <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/gcm">GCM</a> cloud and sending data through this connection. Clean, easy, and less coding work.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="img/intro/gcm-demo.png" alt="gcm-demo" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>After several months, quite a few android users were using their weather report app. Our lucky developers were encouraged by this success and they decided to expand their business to other platforms.</li>
  <li>They noticed that a lot of users were willing to use cell phones developed by a fruit company making this platform so popular that they could not refuse to support.</li>
  <li>(To apple fans: Please forgive for not using their logo, I do not know if I can legally use their logo here. So I have to draw by myself and you can get the idea. Also, Forrest Gump told me it is OK to call it a fruit company.)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="img/intro/apple-and-iphone.png" alt="apple-and-iphone" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The server side developers found documents from this fruit company knowing that they provide a similar cloud service called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=push-notifications">Apple Push Notification Service</a>, or APNs. Again, developers need to establish a connection to APNs cloud and push data to that cloud. Then the cloud would send the data to end users.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="img/intro/apns-demo.png" alt="apns-demo" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>However, it&#8217;s a simple TCP connection this time instead of HTTP connection as in <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/gcm">GCM</a>. Moreover, our developers needed to use another authentication protocol in order to communicate with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=push-notifications">APNs</a>.</li>
  <li>The server side program needed to be changed in order to support both <a href="https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=push-notifications">APNs</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/gcm">GCM</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="img/intro/apns-gcm.png" alt="apns-gcm" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>After adding support to APNs, the project manager wanted to support more platforms, such as BlackBerry. Again, it uses a similar cloud and specific to BlackBerry devices.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="img/intro/blackberry.png" alt="blackberry" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The server side developers became impatient because they were spending too much time to add support to another fancy cloud.</li>
  <li>They needed to focus on what to push to their customers, not how to push messages.</li>
  <li>No more clouds, please!</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="img/intro/noclouds.png" alt="noclouds" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Finally, our clever developers found <strong>uniqush-push</strong> which solved their problem perfectly.</li>
  <li>Developers do not need to know which cloud will be used. They just push messages.</li>
  <li><strong>uniqush-push</strong> will communicate with different clouds through the cloud-specific protocol.</li>
  <li>After running uniqush on their server, server side developers could again simply use an HTTP connection to <strong>uniqush-push</strong> process and send messages to apps on any platform that uniqush supports.</li>
</ul>
