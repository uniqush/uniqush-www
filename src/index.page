## Description

**Uniqush** is a _free_ and _open source_ software which provides a unified
push service for server-side notification to apps on mobile devices. By running
**uniqush** on server side, you can push notification to any supported mobile
platform. [This story](documentation/intro.html) may help you to understand the
basic idea of uniqush.

The latest news about Uniqush will be posted to our
[blog](http://blog.uniqush.org). Or you can follow us on twitter:
[@uniqush](http://twitter.com/uniqush). 

The latest release version is [1.5.0](release-notes/rn-uniqush-push-1-5-0.html).

## Features

- Stand alone server program **dedicated** to push service, which means you can run
  it on your own server.
- Multiple platforms supported for popular smart phone systems including
  android, iOS, etc. And we will support more in the future.
- Simple and unified interface for Apps' server developers. You don't need to
  care about receiver's system, simply send an HTTP request to uniqush server
  and it will do all things for you. 
- No need to implement re-send on failure mechanisms, uniqush will re-send the
  notification on a recoverable error whenever possible.
- Wildcard multicast, so that you can group your users and multicast notifications
  to specific group.
- Native multicast support.

## Supported Platform

**NOTICE**: We will support more in the future.

- [GCM] for Android
- [APNS] for iOS
