ChangeLog:

- *bugfix* Close response body on HTTP response in GCM and C2DM code. This is a
  very common error when using [Go](http://golang.org)'s http client package. I
  thought I have fixed this someday in the past, but it turns out I was wrong.
  Anyway, this fixed [issue 13].
- *bugfix* Fixed a bug introduced by feedback support in APNS. It is a
  missing-return-statement error. Fixed by
  [infiniteloop5](https://github.com/infiniteloop5) through [pull request #17](https://github.com/uniqush/uniqush-push/pull/17)
- *bugfix* Fixed some error in document. Fixed [issue 16] reported by [user974256](https://github.com/user974256).
- *improvement* We do not depends on [redis](http://redis.io) now. Well, not exactly. You just don't need to install redis on the same machine with *uniqush-push*. Fixed [issue 18].
- *feature* Added a new URL path: */nrdp*. Users can check how many delivery points are there under certain subscriber. This feature will be used by [uniqush-conn] and is considered to be a hidden feature. i.e. not intended to be used by users. Fixed [issue 14].
- *feature* Added the so-called *perdp.\** feature. This feature is also used by [uniqush-conn] and is a hidden feature as well. Fixed [issue 15].
