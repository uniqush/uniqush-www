# Release Note 1.4.4

19-Jul-2013

This version contains some minor bug fixes and a *huge* improvement for APNS. I
would like to give special thanks to [cmabastar-gumi] for his detailed bug
reports.

Download:

- [GitHub Releases (rpm, deb, tar.gz)](https://github.com/uniqush/uniqush-push/releases/tag/1.4.4)

ChangeLog:

- *bugfix* Removed some unnecessary information in the
  notification when call on ``/push``. In old versions, service
and subscriber(s) names will be included in the notification.
This may leak some information to the client (e.g. how you name
the client internally.) Fixed [issue 19].
- *bugfix* Fixed a potential memory leak bug affected APNS sandbox
  environment. Fixed [issue 25].
- *bugfix* For APNS, *uniqush-push* now checks the payload size before sending it. Fixed [issue 24].
- *improvement* For APNS, *uniqush-push* now checks the feedback service less frequently so that the performance can be improved a lot. Fixed [issue 26].
- *improvement* Added a [connection pool] support for APNS. Partially fixed [issue 27].
- *improvement* For APNS, *uniqush-push* now does not wait for the error
  response. This is a trade-off to improve the performance. However, for most
errors, *uniqush-push* is able to check them before sending the notification to
APNS. For others, *uniqush-push* is able to recover the error. More details
will be discussed on the [blog]. Partially fixed [issue 27].
