# Release Note 1.3.2

This is a bug fix version. No new features were added.

- *bugfix* Fixed a bug on unsubscription. When a user unsubscribed from a
service and subscribe it again, the database will be in an error state.
Reason: uniqush-push keeps a counter for each delivery points. When a user
unsubscribes, its related delivery point's counter will be decreased by one.
When the counter reaches zero, its corresponding delivery point information
will be deleted. However, in old versions, uniqush-push will not delete the
counter when it reaches zero. Hence there is a bug. This bug was found and
reported by Ivan Yu.
- *bugfix* Fixed a bug when subscribe with identical information. If a delivery
point subscribe a service, its corresponding counter will be increased by
one. If the delivery point has already been added under a certain user, its
counter should not be increased. However, in old versions, uniqush-push will
increase the counter without checking if the delivery point has already under
the same user. This bug was found and reported by Ivan Yu.
- The [uniqush organization on github](http://github.com/uniqush) moved three
repositories under [uniqush-push repository] to merge them into a single
repository. Old repositories will be removed soon. They are: *pushdb*, which
now under *db* directory in [uniqush-push repository]; *pushsys*, which now
under *push* directory in [uniqush-push repository]; *pushsrv*, which now under
*srv* directory in [uniqush-push repository].

Special thanks to Ivan Yu for his bug report.
