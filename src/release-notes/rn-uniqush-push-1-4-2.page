# Release Note 1.4.2

1-Apr-2013 (**This is not a joke!**)

This version contains several bug fixes and a refactoring of the *main* package.

Download:

- [GitHub Releases (rpm, deb, tar.gz)](https://github.com/uniqush/uniqush-push/releases/tag/1.4.2)

ChangeLog:

- *bugfix* Stop on */stop*. Sorry, I forgot to implement the feature after refactoring the main package. Fixed [issue 9].
- *bugfix* Stop on *SIGTERM*. Similar with [issue 9]. User can now stop the program by sending *SIGTERM* to the process. Fixed [issue 8].
- *bugfix* Fixed a nil-pointer crash bug. The program will experience a nil-pointer crash (samething as NULL pointer) under some conditions. For example, if user provides an invalid APIKEY for a GCM provider, then uniqush-push will crash when the user tries to push through this malformed provider. Fixed [issue 10].
- *feature* Support [Feedback Service] in APNS. Fixed [issue 3].
