# Release Note 1.4.2

1-Apr-2013 (**This is not a joke!**)

This version contains several bug fixes and a refactoring of the *main* package.

Download:

- [amd64 1.4.2 deb](http://uniqush.org/downloads/uniqush-push_1.4.2_amd64.deb)
- [amd64 1.4.2 rpm](http://uniqush.org/downloads/uniqush-push-1.4.2-1.x86_64.rpm)
- [amd64 1.4.2 tar.gz](http://uniqush.org/downloads/uniqush-push_1.4.2_x86_64.tar.gz)

ChangeLog:

- *bugfix* Stop on */stop*. Sorry, I forgot to implement the feature after refactoring the main package. Fixed [issue 9].
- *bugfix* Stop on *SIGTERM*. Similar with [issue 9]. User can now stop the program by sending *SIGTERM* to the process. Fixed [issue 8].
- *bugfix* Fixed a nil-pointer crash bug. The program will experience a nil-pointer crash (samething as NULL pointer) under some conditions. For example, if user provides an invalid APIKEY for a GCM provider, then uniqush-push will crash when the user tries to push through this malformed provider. Fixed [issue 10].
- *feature* Support [Feedback Service] in APNS. Fixed [issue 3].
