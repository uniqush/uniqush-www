21-Jul-2018

This release contains documentation, refactoring, and minor bug fixes.

Download:

- [GitHub Releases (rpm, deb, tar.gz)](https://github.com/uniqush/uniqush-push/releases/tag/2.6.1)

ChangeLog:

- Maintenance: Fix various code style warnings from code linters (e.g. gometalinter). Refactor and document code.
- Bugfix: Fix the rare "No device" errors seen when retrying a push. (PR #222)
- Bugfix: Fix the regular expression used as a sanity check of subscriptions and services. (PR #222)
  The intended accepted characters for use in services and subscriptions were `a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _, @ or .`

  Forbid using the backtick in service and subscription names (this was accidentally permitted by the invalid regex).

  Continue allowing a few other invalid characters for now.
  Those may be deprecated in future releases.
