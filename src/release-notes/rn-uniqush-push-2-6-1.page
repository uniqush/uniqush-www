ChangeLog:

- Maintenance: Fix various code style warnings from code linters (e.g. gometalinter). Refactor and document code.
- Bugfix: Fix the rare "No device" errors seen when retrying a push. (PR #222)
- Bugfix: Fix the regular expression used as a sanity check of subscriptions and services. (PR #222)
  The intended accepted characters for use in services and subscriptions were `a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _, @ or .`

  Forbid using the backtick in service and subscription names (this was accidentally permitted by the invalid regex).

  Continue allowing a small number of other invalid characters for now,
  those may be deprecated in future releases.
