ChangeLog:

- Changed the code so that it could work with most recent Go's crypto/tls
  package. The change is made in [this
commit](https://github.com/uniqush/uniqush-push/commit/0ad26471bd0cba16b814fd43fa8723ffc2ca7fd0).
- *bugfix* Fixed a bug in code related to APNS. In 1.5.1, uniqush-push
  calculates waiting time before retry by squaring previous waiting time. This
method leads to integer overflow quickly because we represents time interval in
nanoseconds. Right now, we will randomly increase the waiting time which solves
the integer overflow problem and also reduces the probability of having message
storm.
- *improvement* Report an error when a user trys to add an iOS device with the wrong device token.
