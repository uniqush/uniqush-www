# A Story of an App Development

This document helps you to understand the basic idea of **uniqush-push** by telling a imaginary story of a group of app developers.

- Once upon a time, there was a group of developers developing weather report app for mobile devices.
  They were from the open source community and hence preferred open platforms. Android was their choice.
- The idea of their app was naive and simple: sending weather report from their server to their app every day.

![android-and-android-rain]

- On android platform, sending a notification to an app is easy: [Google] provides a cloud service, [Google Cloud Message], or GCM, to help developers to send data from servers to apps.
- Developers could push any data to their apps by sending an HTTP request to [GCM] cloud.
- Empowered by [GCM], the developers were quite happy to write server side programs. They didn't need to consider the systems on which the app run. [GCM] did all works. Everything they need to do was grabbing weather information, establishing HTTP connection to [GCM] cloud and sending data through this connection. Clean, easy, and less coding work.

- After several months, quite a few android users were using their weather report app. Our lucky developers were encouraged by this success and they decided to expand their business to other platforms.
- They noticed that a lot of users were willing to use cell phones developed by a fruit company making this platform so popular that they could not refuse to support.
- (To apple fans: Please forgive for not using their logo, I do not know if I can legally use their logo here. So I have to draw by myself and you can get the idea. Also, Forrest Gump told me it is OK to call it a fruit company.)

- The server side developers found documents from this fruit company knowing that they provide a similar cloud service called [Apple Push Notification Service], or APNs. Again, developers need to establish a connection to APNs cloud and push data to that cloud. Then the cloud would send the data to end users.

- However, it's a simple TCP connection this time instead of HTTP connection as in [GCM]. Moreover, our developers needed to use another authentication protocol in order to communicate with [APNs].
- The server side program needed to be changed in order to support both [APNs] and [GCM].

![apns-gcm]

- After adding support to APNs, the project manager wanted to support more platforms, such as BlackBerry. Again, it uses a similar cloud and specific to BlackBerry devices.

- The server side developers became impatient because they were spending too much time to add support to another fancy cloud.
- They needed to focus on what to push to their customers, not how to push messages.
- No more clouds, please!

![noclouds]

- Finally, our clever developers found **uniqush-push** which solved their problem perfectly.
- Developers do not need to know which cloud will be used. They just push messages.
- **uniqush-push** will communicate with different clouds through the cloud-specific protocol.
- After running uniqush on their server, server side developers could again simply use an HTTP connection to **uniqush-push** process and send messages to apps on any platform that uniqush supports.
