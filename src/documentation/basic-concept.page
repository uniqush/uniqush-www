# Basic Concept

This document explains some basic concepts in Uniqush's terminology. Understanding these terms is critical to use Uniqush. Fortunately, it won't be too hard to capture these ideas.

## Sending Notifications Through Clouds

- Many clouds are available to push data from a server side program to mobile devices.

- Each cloud is dedicated to its own mobile platform. e.g. a cloud named [GCM] (or [FCM]) for Android; a cloud named [APNs] for iOS, etc.

![clouds2platforms]

- If an app server want to send data to its end user, it first sends the data to the corresponding cloud.

![server2cloud]

- Then the cloud will delivery the data to the app running on the device.

- If a server wants to support multiple mobile platforms, it has to communicate with different clouds through different protocols.

## Uniqush Gets Involved

- By running Uniqush, the server can send data to multiple clouds through Uniqush using **one and only one** protocol.
The server program first sends the data to the Uniqush process through HTTP,
then Uniqush will send the data to each cloud using cloud-specific protocols.
We call each cloud a **Push Service Provider**.
Supporting more platforms is easy for the server side, because Uniqush did all the dirty work.
- **Definition** *Push Service Provider*: An entity which can push data to a device. Uniqush handles protocol to different Push Service Providers, hiding all communication details from the server.

- The serve only need to care about **who** subscribes to **which** service. For example, the server may provide weather report service, called *Local Weather*. Then John installed the Local Weather app on his device and **subscribes** the service.
- **Definition** *Service*: An entity which can generate data ready to be sent to remote device. A service is the source of information.
- **Definition** *Subscriber*: An entity which consumes the information generated from the service. A subscriber is the sink of information.

![johnsubweather]

- When server wants to send weather report to John, it needs only to tell Uniqush three things: the **Service** (Local Weather), the **Subscriber** (John), and the **Data** (rain, cloudy, etc.)

![john-weather-data]

- Moreover, John has several cell phones. All of them subscribe the Local Weather service.
  He wants each device to be able to receive messages from the server.
  We call each device a **Delivery Point**.
  Each subscriber may have several delivery points.
- **Definition** *Delivery Point*: An entity which receives data from one or more Services.
  It must have a subscriber as its Owner.
  One subscriber may have more than one delivery point.
- The server side program could simply tell 3 things to Uniqush: **who** --- the subscriber; **where** --- the service, i.e. where is the subscriber; and **what** --- the data. Uniqush will send data to each delivery point of that subscriber.

## Review

Here are important concepts that we mentioned in this document. Understanding these concepts is critical, and we have listed them here for your convenience.

### Push Service Provider

A push service provider can push data to a device. Uniqush handles protocol to different Push Service Providers, hiding all communication details from the server.

Examples:  [GCM] (or [FCM]) can send notifications to Android devices;  [APNS] can send notifications to iOS devices.

### Service

A service can generate data ready to be sent to apps running on remote device. A service is the source of information. One server may provide more than one service.

Examples: Local Weather service; Local News service.

### Subscriber

A subscriber consumes the information generated from the service. A subscriber is the sink of information. In most cases a subscriber usually refers to a real person.

Example: A person who installed Local News app on his / her cell phone.

### Delivery Point

A Delivery Point receives data from one or more Services. It must have a subscriber as its Owner. One subscriber may have more than one delivery point.

Examples: an Android device; an iOS device; a BlackBerry, etc.
