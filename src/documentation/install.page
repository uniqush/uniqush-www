# Installing Uniqush and its Dependencies

## Installing uniqush-push

`uniqush-push` is now the only component of Uniqush.

It is highly recommended to install the **binary** package on a **64-bit** system.

### Install Redis

The only dependency of `uniqush-push` is [Redis], which is a key-value database.

Redis should be installed on a server that has low latency to the server
`uniqush-push` is installed on (e.g. the same datacenter). One solution is to
install both programs on the same server.

- On Debian-based systems (including [Debian], [Ubuntu], [Mint], etc.), run:

    `sudo apt-get install redis-server`

- On yum-based systems (including [Red Hat Enterprise Linux], [Fedora], [CentOS], etc.), run:

    `sudo yum install redis-server`

- For other systems, please visit the [Redis] website for more information.

### Install uniqush-push

- Download the latest `uniqush-push` binary package appropriate for your system from the [download page] or you can build it from source. Go 1.6+ is recommended.
- If you are using a Debian-based system, you can install the DEB:

    `sudo dpkg -i uniqush-push\_VERSION\_ARCH.deb`

- If you are using yum/rpm-based system, you can install the RPM:

    `sudo rpm -ivh uniqush-push-VERSION-ARCH.rpm`

- Otherwise, you can always install uniqush-push using the tarball:

    * unpack the file:

        `tar zxvf uniqush-push-VERSION-ARCH.tar.gz`

    * enter that directory and execute *install.sh* under that directory:

        `cd uniqush-VERSION-ARCH/ && sudo ./install.sh`

### Running uniqush-push

- If `uniqush-push` is installed via the binary packages from the [download page], then there will be two files copied to your system:

    * `/usr/bin/uniqush-push`, which is an executable file.
    * `/etc/uniqush/uniqush-push.conf`, which is a configuration file.


- To run `uniqush-push`, type `uniqush-push` in a console.

- Please read [Configuration](config.html) and [Using Uniqush](usage.html) for more details
